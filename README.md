🎮 Custom Login and Cloud Game Data System
A complete solution for user authentication and cloud-based game data management, built with Unity3D, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.

🔗 Repositories Used
To fully test and run the system, use all three repositories together:

🎮 Unity3d_project_for_login_saveGame
→ Unity3D client for game login, register, and save game data

🌐 Nodejs_server_for_Unity3dGame_Login_saveData
→ Node.js + MongoDB backend server

🖥️ webapp_for_Unity3dGame_nextjs-
→ Next.js frontend web app for login, account creation, and password reset using the same backend

🛠️ Features
